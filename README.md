The screen scraping portion of the application works by invoking an embedded version of the Edge web browswer.  This requires a library to be installed on the user's computer.
If the library is not already installed on your machine, then the embedded web browswer on the Georeferencer tab will not render the page. In that case, you can install the library
from this address.
